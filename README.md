All PDF files in this guide have been checked by VirusTotal (**Note that this guide does not endorse VirusTotal at all and it should be used with extreme caution and never with any sensitive files due to their "privacy policy".**)

In addition, you can always double check them using PDFID which you can download at <https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/>

- Install Python, Download PDFID and run:

```python pdfid.py file-to-check.pdf```

And you should see these at 0:

```
/JS                    0 #This indicates the presence of Javascript
/JavaScript            0 #This indicates the presence of Javascript
/AA                    0 #This indicates the presence of automatic action on opening
/OpenAction            0 #This indicates the presence of automatic action on opening
/AcroForm              0 #This indicates the presence of AcroForm which could contain JavaScript
/JBIG2Decode           0 #This indicates the PDF uses JBIG2 compression which could be used for obfuscating malicious content
/RichMedia             0 #This indicates the presence rich media within the PDF such as Flash
/Launch                0 #This counts the launch actions
/EmbeddedFile          0 #This indicates there are embedded files within the PDF
/XFA                   0 #This indicates the presence of XML Forms within the PDF
```

SHA256 Checksums of all the PDFs are available within <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/raw/main/sha256sum.txt>
SHA256 Checksums of the release files are available within the checksum file at <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/releases/latest>

To check the SHA256 Checksums please do the following:

Windows:
- From a command prompt, run ```certutil -hashfile filename.txt sha256```
- Compare the result with the hash in the checksum files.

MacOS:
- From a terminal, run ```shasum -a 256 /full/path/to/your/file```
- Compare the result with the hash in the checksum files.

Linux: 
- From a terminal, ```run sha256sum /full/path/to/your/file```
- Compare the result with the hash in the checksum files.

All commits and releases on this repository are signed and verified using the same key. Check for the "Verified" tags.

PDFs, Images and release files are also signed separately using GPG (see the .asc files on the release page and within the repository).

If you don't know how to verify files with GGP signatures, you should first install gpg on your system:
- Windows: Install gpg4win from <https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html>
- MacOS: Install GPG Tools from <https://gpgtools.org/>
- Linux: gpg should be installed by default

Import the GPG key using the following command from a command prompt or terminal:

```gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys 0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601```

If it doesn't work, you can also download/view it directly from here: <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/raw/main/AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc>

And then import it manually by issuing the following command:

```gpg --import AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc```

Finally verify the files by issuing the following commands: 

```gpg --verify guide.pdf.asc guide.pdf"```

```gpg --verify guide-p.pdf.asc guide-p.pdf"```

```gpg --verify guide-dark.pdf.asc guide-dark.pdf"```

You can also verify the authenticity of this GPG signature using my Keybase.io profile <https://keybase.io/anonymousplanet> and the PGP key is also published on <http://keys.gnupg.net/>, <https://pgp.mit.edu/> and <https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/> using the following PGP fingerprint: ```0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601```
