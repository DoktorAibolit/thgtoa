SHA256 Checksums of all the files are available within <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/raw/main/sha256sum.txt>

All the files of this project are also signed using GPG (see the .sig files in the repository).

If you don't know how to verify files with GGP signatures, you should first install gpg on your system:
- Windows: Install gpg4win from <https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html>
- MacOS: Install GPG Tools from <https://gpgtools.org/>
- Linux: gpg should be installed by default

Import the GPG key using the following command from a command prompt or terminal: "gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys 0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601" 

If it doesn't work, you can also download/view it directly from here: <https://github.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa/raw/main/AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc>

And then import it manually by issuing the following command: "gpg --import AnonymousPlanet_0x89DAB601_public.asc" (or any other file you saved it to). Or if you're using indows, just use the import function within the Kleopatra app.

Finally verify the files by issuing the following commands: "gpg --verify guide.md.sig guide.md" and "gpg --verify guide.pdf.sig guide.pdf".

Alternatively on Windows if you installed gpg4win, just double click any sig file and it will automatically check the file in question for validity using Kleopatra.
The result should show a good signature for each file.

You can also verify the authenticity of this gpg signature using my Keybase.io profile <https://keybase.io/anonymousplanet> and the PGP key is also published on <http://keys.gnupg.net/>, <https://pgp.mit.edu/> and <https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/> using the following PGP fingerprint: 0xEB16B6AB4AB7BA61F33E2DFD0051E9A589DAB601

All commits on this repository are signed and verified using the same key.

For safety, an automated mirror of this repository is also located at GitLab here: <https://gitlab.com/AnonymousPlanet/thgtoa>
